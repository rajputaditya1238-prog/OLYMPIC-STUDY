This project analyzes the history and trends of the Olympic Games using the Olympics dataset with the help of Tableau. The dataset includes details about athletes, events, countries, and medal tallies across multiple years, allowing a wide range of insights to be drawn.

The visualizations highlight key areas such as:

Participation growth: Tracking the rise in athletes and countries over time.

Medal tally: Identifying top-performing nations and their consistency across editions.

Gender analysis: Exploring how male and female participation has evolved in Olympic history.

Athlete profiles: Studying demographics like age, height, and weight to understand patterns across sports.

Geographical view: Mapping medal contributions by country for better global perspective.

I developed individual sheets to focus on specific aspects of the data, then combined them into dashboards to provide interactive and comparative views. Finally, I created a story in Tableau to connect the visuals into a structured narrative that highlights the most important findings.

This project shows how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights using visual analytics. It also demonstrates the storytelling power of Tableau by combining interactivity with data-driven exploration. Overall, the project offers a clear and engaging way to study the journey of the Olympics over time.

Do you want me to also make a one-paragraph shorter version (around 100â€“120 words) that you can use as a LinkedIn post intro?
